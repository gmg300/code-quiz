## Description
Code quiz (initially named to be a quiz containing coding-based questions) is a single-page web app using HTML, CSS(tailwindcss) and pure JS that serves 10 geography questions with a multiple choice answering system. Along side generating the questions and answers in random order the web app includes scoring based off a built-in timer, answer feedback, and a localStorage based high score board that accepts usernames with scores and basic management like deleting old scores. 

**Challenges**
This project had many different moving pieces that made it more complicated than any of my past projects. Some of the hardest challenges were basic organization of the relatively large amount of javascript, timer formatting and start, stop, pause functions, implementing effective answer feedback and random question generation. 

**v0.2.0**
* Improvement - Refactored js using Jquery library
* Improvement - Total refactor/reorg of the existing js, maintaining functionality but breaking code into more readable re-usable functions
* New - Fail and success cards have been eliminated and replaced with a more generic but dynamic "score card" at the end, displaying score and initials input if the user finishes the quiz and a try again button if they fail.

**Future Versions**
* Redesign the UI to be more responsive and visually pleasing
* Implement a leaderboard system within the highscore board which displays scores from highest to lowest
* Make the js more clean and efficient in general
