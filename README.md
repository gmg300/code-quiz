# Code Quiz v0.1

## Description
Code quiz is a single-page web app using HTML, CSS(tailwindcss) and pure JS that serves 10 geography questions with a multiple choice answering system. Along side generating the questions and answers in random order the web app includes scoring based off a built-in timer, answer feedback, and a localStorage based high score board that accepts usernames with scores and basic management like deleting old scores. 

This project had many different moving pieces that made it more complicated than any of my past projects. Some of the hardest challenges were basic organization of the relatively large amount of javascript, timer formatting and start, stop, pause functions, implementing effective answer feedback and random question generation. 

In the future I would like to refactor the JS using a library (JQuery) or modern framework (React or Vue). I'd also like to redesign the UI from its current basic look and feel. I would also like to implement a hierarchy within the high score board so that scores are checked against each other and are displayed from highest to lowest like a leaderboard.
